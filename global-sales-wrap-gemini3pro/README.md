# Global Sales Antigravity Website

A highly functional static website demonstrating advanced front-end effects, including:
- **Physics Engine Integration**: Uses Matter.js to create a "Google Antigravity" style effect where product cards are physical bodies that fall, collide, and can be thrown.
- **Dynamic Content**: Generates 100+ high-quality product cards programmatically.
- **3D & CSS Effects**: Custom mouse cursor trails, 3D tilt effects based on velocity, and glassmorphism UI.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to screen size, with dynamic wall boundaries for the physics simulation.

## How to Run
Since this is a static website with no backend dependencies:
1. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
2. **Interaction**:
    - **Toggle Gravity**: Click the button in the top right to switch gravity on/off. When off, items float.
    - **Drag & Throw**: Use your mouse to grab any product card and throw it.
    - **Hover**: Elements glow and react to the cursor.
